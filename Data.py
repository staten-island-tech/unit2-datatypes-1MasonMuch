#Basic Float Example
# x = 3
# y = float(3)
# print(x,y)
#what this code does is assign a value to "x" and "y"
# when you put float in front of a number in parenthesis it makes it a decimal
#then it prints x and prints y.

# the output would be: 3 3.0

#lists
# values = [1,2.23,5,7,2,30,15]
# print(values)
# for i in values:
#     print(i)

# print(values[0])
# print(values[6])

# print(values[7]) -This wouldnt work since there is no value "7" 
#python starts counting at 0
